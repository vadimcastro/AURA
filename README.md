# AURA — Autonomous Utility & Reputation Architecture

> A Sui-native reputation routing, policy-enforced wallet, and verifiable memory auditing protocol for autonomous trading agents executing on DeepBook Predict.

---

## The Problem

AgentFi introduces a fundamental tension: **how do you delegate financial execution to autonomous code without exposing the user to total capital loss, fraud, or untrustworthy agents?**

Today, autonomous trading agents on-chain face three unsolved problems:
1. **Unconstrained execution** — agents with key access can drain wallets to arbitrary addresses
2. **No skin in the game** — agent operators risk nothing when their bots lose user funds
3. **Opaque reasoning** — users can't verify *why* an agent made a specific trade

AURA solves all three with a protocol-level architecture built on Sui Move primitives.

### Three Decoupled Layers

| Layer | Module | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution Boundary** | `agent_wallet_policy.move` | Policy-enforced wallet using a Hot Potato / TradeTicket pattern. Funds can only flow to allowlisted contracts within atomic PTBs. |
| **Incentive Alignment** | `aura_registry.move`, `agent_nft.move` | Reputation registry with SUI stake bonds, optimistic slashing dispute games, and AgentNFT Kiosk wrapping. |
| **Telemetry & Audit** | `walrus_archiver.ts` | Seal-encrypted audit traces archived to Walrus, with `blob_id` committed on-chain for verifiable history. |

---

## Key Features

- **🔒 Hot Potato Trade Tickets** — Agent borrows funds via `borrow_for_trade`, receives a `TradeTicket` (no abilities), must return it via `return_and_complete` in the same PTB. Funds physically cannot leave the approved execution path.

- **💰 Budget Ceiling & Safety Floor** — Per-policy `budget_limit` caps cumulative spend. `min_balance_floor` prevents over-commitment. Clamped subtraction handles profitable trades without underflow.

- **🔥 Deflationary Buy/Burn Insurance** — Implements a 0.5% fee on profitable options executions inside `agent_wallet_policy.move` routed directly to `@buy_and_burn_insurance`, executing a twin function of deflationary token value capture and a slashing insurance backstop for high-reputation operators.

- **🗜️ Verifiable State History Compression** — Aggregates raw Walrus telemetry logs periodically (every 5 cycles) into a dense, encrypted "Strategy Summary String" on Walrus to prevent LLM context window overflow while preserving long-term memory.

- **🧠 Hybrid Validator-Consensus Pattern** — Employs a dual-layer AI strategy: a lightning-fast `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free` "Grunt" executor running under a deterministic TypeScript Sanity Sandbox, combined with an off-chain background "Thinker" Panel consensus trio (`nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`, `qwen/qwen3-coder:free`, and `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`) periodically summarizing historical Walrus traces to update strategy prompts off the live trading path.

- **📊 Optimistic Slashing Dispute Game** — Replaces trusted admin slashing. Users submit disputes by locking a dispute bond. Operators must disclose the decryption key within 24 hours. Failure automatically slashes the operator's performance bond and awards it to the challenger.

- **🏬 Sui Kiosk Strategy NFT wrapping** — High-performing strategy records and reputations can be packaged into an `AgentNFT` containing snapshots of the agent's exact model/orchestration parameters, then placed in a shared `sui::kiosk::Kiosk` to create a tradeable marketplace with high switching costs.

- **🔐 Seal-Encrypted Audit Trails** — Trade reasoning is encrypted client-side via Seal, uploaded to Walrus, and the `blob_id` is committed on-chain. Disputes trigger decryption for verification.

- **🌐 Hybrid Onboarding (dApp-kit)** — Combines browser extension wallets (Backpack/Sui Wallet) via standard `@mysten/dapp-kit` context providers with Web2 social zkLogin (Google, GitHub) fallback.

- **⏰ Expiration & Revocation** — Policies expire by epoch. Owner can `revoke_policy` at any time, destroying the shared object and reclaiming all funds.

- **📡 Full Event Emission** — Every state change emits a structured event for indexing, monitoring, and the Walrus archiver pipeline.

### ⚙️ Live Walkthrough Progression
To test the complete end-to-end AURA setup:
1. **Start Server:** Start the off-chain daemon runner (Vite dashboard's Operator tab or `npm run runner` inside `/sdk`).
2. **Register Agent:** Register a new autonomous agent via the dashboard Directory tab to post SUI collateral stake.
3. **Prompt Engine Trade:** Input natural language queries into the Intent Engine tab to mint option ranges on DeepBook.
4. **Configure & Audit:** Ingest telemetry summaries, decrypt mind trails, and adjust risk policies under the Audit Studio.

## Ecosystem Alignment

AURA is designed to align with and contribute across multiple Sui ecosystem tracks:

| Track | Alignment |
|---|---|
| **Agentic Web → Autonomous Agent Wallet** | Primary — AURA is the ultimate *Autonomous Agent Wallet* utilizing the Hot Potato `TradeTicket` pattern to enforce policy budgets, delegating secure execution boundaries to third-party scripts. |
| **DeFi & Payments** | Strong — programmable financial workflows via PTB-atomic trade execution and fee mechanics. |
| **Walrus** | Strong — verifiable long-term agent memory with Seal encryption, including Reflective Memory loops for dynamic strategy optimization and Crash-Recovery State Machines. |
| **DeepBook Predict** | Supporting — volatility-aware trading strategy backed by verifiable `OracleSVI` calculations logged in audit traces to prove active volatility-surface pricing. |
